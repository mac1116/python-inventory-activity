# Activity 1 - Python Inventory System
## Problem description:

| Instruction |

### Create an inventory program using the following data structures:
- A list to store item names
- A dictionary to store the corresponding item prices

### The program should allow the user to:
1. Add a new item
  - Ask for the item name
  - Ask for the price
  - Add it to both the list and dictionary
  - Prevent duplicate item names

2. Update the price of an existing item
  - Ask for the item name
  - If it exists, update its price
  - If it doesn't exist, show an error message
  - Use loops and conditionals for the menu.

### Do NOT include deleting items or out-of-stock features.
